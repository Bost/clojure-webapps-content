# Code so far

  The code and configuration we have created so far are in the [clojure-webapps-example](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-webapps-example) github repository, specifically the branch called `02-refactor-route-handling`

  If something is not working or you want to speed up, simply clone the project into a new directory using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-webapps-example
```
Once you have cloned the project, checkout the `02-refactor-route-handling` branch

```bash
git checkout 02-refactor-route-handling
```
