# Code so far

  The code and configuration we have created so far are in the [clojure-webapps-example](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-webapps-example) github repository, specifically the branch called `03-middleware-in-ring`

  If something is not working or you want to speed up, simply clone the project into a new directory using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-webapps-example
```
Once you have cloned the project, checkout the `03-middleware-in-ring` branch

```bash
git checkout 03-middleware-in-ring
```
